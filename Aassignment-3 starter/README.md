# Bat vs Rat — HIT140 Project Starter

This starter project contains basic code and templates to help a 3-person team begin Assessment 3 (Investigation A & B).

Work Completed This Week

    Group meeting held to discuss overall plan for Assignment 3 (Investigations A & B) and assign team roles.

    Task allocation completed:

    Aarjit → Data cleaning and preparation.

    Yukrit → Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.

    Aanchal → Statistical analysis and report writing.

    Project structure created:

    Folders for src, reports, notebooks, and datasets.

    Added starter files: analysis.py, README.md, requirements.txt, and weekly_report_template.md.

    Starter code implemented in src/analysis.py:

    Loads and summarizes both dataset1.csv and dataset2.csv.

    Prints shapes, data types, sample rows, and numeric summaries.

    Performs an initial check of risk vs. seconds_after_rat_arrival (Investigation A preview).

    Initial exploratory results obtained:

    dataset1.csv → 907 rows; average risk ≈ 49.5%.

    dataset2.csv → 2123 rows; summarized bat landings, rat minutes, and food availability.

    Early insight: bats’ risk-taking behaviour varies slightly with rat proximity.

    Project uploaded to GitHub (in progress) — ZIP prepared and ready for version control.

Work In Progress

    Cleaning and converting time columns (start_time, rat_period_start, etc.) into datetime formats.

    Identifying missing or inconsistent data.

    Setting up basic visualizations (distributions and comparisons by season).

    Next Steps (For Next Week)

    Complete full data cleaning and preprocessing.

    Generate descriptive plots (Member B).

    Begin statistical tests (Member C): chi-square and logistic regression for Investigation A.

    Update the weekly report and push cleaned data and code to GitHub.

Issues / Notes

    Some date/time columns need consistent formatting before further analysis.

    Clarify variable meaning for reward and habit to interpret correctly in statistical models.
    Files:
    - src/analysis.py : simple Python script that reads datasets and prints EDA summaries.
    - requirements.txt : minimal Python packages.
    - reports/weekly_report_template.md : weekly report template to copy into Learnline submissions.
    - speaker_notes.md : 10-minute combined speaking script split among three presenters.
    - notebooks/notebook_starter.ipynb : placeholder notebook for team exploration.
